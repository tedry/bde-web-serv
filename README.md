Delphi BDE Database application to Linux web-server

-RESTWebServer- is a Delphi 10 Linux Web-server with a custom REST API. 

-WebConnector- is a Delphi 10 MS Windows application that bridges live access 
between older local BDE Database applications and Linux RESTWebservers.

Using the WebConnector on an MS Windows OS allows the support of Delphi BDE applications as-is 
to communicate with a Linux Web-server live, without modification to the existing BDE application 
or its Database. 

The RESTWebServer supports the back-end communications to any number of WebConnectors on different Windows systems, allowing thousands of live connections to BDE applications from the Web-server.
